# charging-market
A standalone example for a zero sum charging market problem with a demand-response price model. The problem setup, as well as theoeretical guaruntees for our methods, are provided in our paper: 

K. Wood and E. Dall'Anese. Stochastic Saddle Point Problems with Decision-Dependent Distributions.*arxiv preprint arxiv:2201.02313*, 2022

The arxiv preprint can be found here https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02313. 

### Details
This is a python codebase used to generate figures for our work by comparing stochastic methods to compute equilibrium points and saddle points. The data used in our simulations is not provided, but a link to the raw data is found below. 

### Requirements
Raw data can be found here: https://doi.org/10.7799/1827356.
